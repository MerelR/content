# What is new

### User interace overhaul
Version 7 is a complete overhaul of the user interface. User interaction has been reconsidered and we have given the user interface a fresh new and modern look.

### Edit projects on Windows, Mac and Linux
We have replaced legacy user interface technology with a new frontend architecture. Consequently, we now offer desktop applications of the project editor for Windows, Mac and Linux.

### Edit projects inside the Cloud
Version 7 offers variaDoc as a cloud application or Software as a Service (SaaS). The cloud application runs on a reliable cloud infrastructure. It is delivered through the web browser and does not require any downloads or installations on the client side.

### Turn your project into a Web API
Every project stored inside the variaDoc cloud application can be deployed as a web API with literally a single click.
